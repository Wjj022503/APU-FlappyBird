This project aim for practicing JavaScript basics and familliar with p5.js libraries.

This project include files:
1. img - stored graphic resources

5. index.html & style.css - basic structure for web project.

I used p5.js libraries to draw graphics on webpage, JavaScript to manipulate in-game data and write the basic logic of the game.
